## The Creolitos Approach

Creolitos is an educational initiative dedicated to nurturing multilingualism, cultural confidence, and literacy from early childhood onward. Through literature, arts-based learning, and meaningful cultural experiences, children don’t just learn a language — they build connection, identity, and joy.
